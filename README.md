### Description

Scans your computer for registry errors and removes them. I don't know why but the last time I tried to improve Registry Duster 1.0, everyone told me that it didn't work. I tried backtracking to see what was wrong. I'm not sure if I fixed the problems, but it works for me. I'm not done finished with this project yet, so I need as many improvements and fixes as possible. KEEP GIVING ME RATINGS, IMPROVEMENTS, AND COMMENTS NO MATTER HOW LONG I HAVE HAD THIS PROJECT UPLOADED!
